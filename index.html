                            I am really excited about web development! I am fascinated by the incredible
                            creative potential of programming. Within the wires and circuitry of computers
                            we fashion new worlds unconstrained by the ordinary laws that govern the outside
                            world. I grew up with electronics one might say. Nintendo was a big part of my
                            childhood. I was born in March 1983. Super-Mario was born that same June.

                            I remember when Super-Mario 3 came out. My dad was living in this apartment in Fresno.
                            I liked that apartment. It had new clean but soon to be destroyed (by his 3 small
                            children and their trusty side-kick Justin) carpet. And when we spilled birthday cake
                            on the floor that night and Eli knocked over his orange sodaâ€”the ants emerged numerous and
                            single file; trudging through an orange soda swamp towards birthday cake boulders
                            obediently carrying their
                            body weight in crumbs back to the queen. That is... until my father burst through the door,
                            simple green in hand, "you motherfuckers" he cursed - to the ants of course. We stayed
                            awake as
                            long as we could and played Super-Mario 3 until pink clouds came peeking from the pale
                            morning
                            sky through the blinds into our empty
                            apartment bedroom where we sat laughing to each-other as we recounted to one another over
                            and
                            over again
                            the hilarious scene and repeated our father's oath upon the ants with tears of laughter in
                            our
                            eyes.
                        </p>

                        <p id="p3">
                            Mariah was the first of us to play Super Nintendo. Eli and I had gone with our mom on a
                            trip to Baja. Riah stayed behind. What had happened was that Dad's house got broken into
                            and the TV and the Nintendo had gotten stolen. Once dad got the insurance money, he got
                            us a Super-Nintendo. I remember talking to my sister on the phone and her telling me about
                            it. First she told me about the burglary and how they took the Nintendo. I was horrified.
                            Then she told me that we got a Super-Nintendo, and I could hardly contain myself.
                            Super-MarioWorld still might be the best game ever created.
